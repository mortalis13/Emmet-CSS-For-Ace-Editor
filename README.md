# Emmet CSS Script For Ace Editor
Emmet script for Ace editor CSS mode in Wordpress.  
Contains `emmet` object definition and CSS snippets.  

It's taken from the [emmet-core](https://github.com/cloud9ide/emmet-core) repository and then reduced to use in Wordpress.  
The Underscore definition was removed because Wordpress load the library.  
All snippets except CSS were removed too.

This package was used by me to create custom CSS editor in the theme Options page in Wordpress admin side.
